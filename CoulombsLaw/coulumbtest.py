Unit Tests for Coulomb's Law Calculation

This module contains unit tests for verifying the behavior of the `calculate_electric_force`
function in the `coulomb` module. It utilizes the `unittest` framework to ensure the
correct calculation of electric force between two point charges under various scenarios.
