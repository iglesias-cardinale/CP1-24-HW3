"""
This module provides functions for calculating the electric force between two point charges
using Coulomb's law and simulating how this force evolves over time as the distance between
the charges changes.

The module includes:
1. A constant for converting microcoulombs to coulombs.
2. A function `time_evolution` for simulating the electric force over time as the distance
   between the charges changes.
3. A `main` function that interacts with the user to input charges, distance, and other parameters,
   and calculates the electric force, displaying the results over time.

    Simulates the time evolution of the electric force between two charges over a series of time steps.

    Parameters:
    q1: The charge of the first object (in Coulombs).
    q2: The charge of the second object (in Coulombs).
    r_initial: The initial distance between the two charges (in centimeters).
    r_change_rate: The rate of change of the distance between the charges per time step (in centimeters).

    Returns:
    A list containing the time step and the corresponding electric force (in Newtons).

    The function prints the distance and electric force at each time step, and returns a list of the force values
